TicTacToe - simple implementation of immortal game, where two players, X and O, take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.


Fore(after)word:
I treat this project strictly as a way to improve my C programming skills. I doubt that anyone would be interested in it, but.. here it goes! :)
Since starting this project, I have implemented:
* PvAI
* Multilanguage support
* Settings support
Although AI is far from ideal, I am really proud for what I have done with the project. I will definitely try to revisit it later in the future. I undertook this project mid-October. Bare game was ready in three days. AI was done by the end of November. Most of the work on separate files was done in Januray, as my exam session has caught me off-guard (hopefully it will not happen again). I also planned to prepare server (and GUI) for TTT v0.1.0, however my plans (while being very optimistic to say the least) included immense amount of work which I couldn't take upon myself at the time. It is my dream, however, to revisit this project later on with more experience under my belt. I am proud of what I have done (even though it is a Tic Tac Toe.. how many of you have created Tic Tac Toe?).

If you want to contribute to the project by creating translation file (or improving the code), feel free to do so. All you need to do is follow the convention of .lang files - each line has its corresponding index in the string table, so it should be pretty straight forward to create your own translation. When it is ready, you have to include your file in whitelist present in settings.c/languages.c. You can do it!
